        <p>Cali’s cheerful nature is manifested in salsa, a Caribbean rhythm that is danced here among the sugarcane in its own unique way. In this city, nicknamed "Branch of Heaven,” the peaks of Cristo Rey, the hill of the Three Crosses, and the hills of San Antonio jut upwards from the plains that make up most of Valle del Cauca.</p>

          <p>Cali is served by Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport located in the City of Palmira. It is Colombia's third largest airport and is connected to the city by a highway known as the "recta a Palmira", that in the last few years has been upgraded to make the airport more accessible to Cali and the surrounding city centers in the region. <br>Overview: Cali is a Colombian city in the Valle del Cauca department, southwest of Bogotá. It’s known for salsa dancing and there are many clubs in the suburb of Juanchito. In Cali’s oldest quarter, the neoclassical San Pedro Cathedral houses paintings of the Quito School. Nearby is the 18th- and 19th-century San Francisco Religious Complex. La Merced Chapel is where the first mass was held after Cali was founded in 1536.</p>

          <p>Cali, founded in 1536, can be explored on foot: walk under the shade of trees along the riverbank, admire the architecture of churches and other national monuments, and visit the city’s many museums. In Cali, travelers can enjoy music festivals, learn about sugarcane farming, and take in the mountainous landscapes.</p>

          <p>The World Salsa Festival takes place in Cali every September; it’s an event not to be missed. Famous bands and about 5,000 dancers from all of the salsa dance schools in the city join dance academies from other cities and abroad. Talks and meetings for music lovers and collectors are also held during the festival.<br>Once a year, in the heart of Colombia’s third largest city, Santiago de Cali, natives and tourists alike flock in their thousands to delight in the six-day-long salsa dancing and music extravaganza that is the Feria de Cali. <br>Beginning on 25th December with the mesmerizingly-energetic one-mile-long El Salsódromo parade and ending with an unforgettably-lively concert on 30th December, the festival prides itself on creating a true party atmosphere for its visitors from start to finish. For those visitors not particularly knowledgeable or experienced in the art of salsa dancing, there is arguably a no better way to educate yourself in the dance style than to witness first-hand the impressively-quick steps and skipping motions performed by the Feria de Cali’s talented dancers.</p>
