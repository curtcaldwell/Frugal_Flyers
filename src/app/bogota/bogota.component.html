          <p>Taking place annually in mid April, FILBO is an annual international book fair that attracts visitors from all over the world. The Bogotá International Book Fair started in 1987, after identifying a need to hold a professional fair that would foster the development of a massive promotional reading campaign, through a national and international interest cultural program, and an organized quality exhibition of national and international publishing funds. The Fair is one of the most representative and traditional cultural events of our country but specifically in Colombia’s capital city. In addition, it is internationally recognized and has become one of the most important high level events in Latin America.</p>
